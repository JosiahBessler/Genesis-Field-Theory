⚠️ Disclaimer — Preliminary, Unverified Theoretical & Numerical Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The documents in this Tests/DarkMatter directory contain exploratory analyses produced during the development of the Genesis Field Theory (GenFT) dark-matter framework. These files include:

operator reconstruction attempts

eigenmode verification tests

ΔK(r) correction analysis

strong-lensing and mid-band mode studies

UCP → MID-mode comparisons

multi-band UV/MID/IR decomposition results

All numerical work and interpretations were performed by a single independent, non-expert researcher, with explanatory text assisted by large-language-model AI tools.

There has been no astrophysics validation, no peer review, and no independent replication.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔸 What These Files Represent

The documents in this folder capture early attempts to:

evaluate whether UCP behaves like an IR-band eigenmode

test reconstructed mid-band profiles against operator K

explore strong-lensing constraints

compute effective eigenvalues under free-field and effective K

analyze ΔK(r) needed to map UCP → optimized MID mode

decompose synthetic lens halos into UV/MID/IR components

examine how operator-based dark-matter modes might emerge in GenFT

These analyses are conceptual and experimental only.

They illustrate possible mathematical structures, but they do not establish any verified physical claims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔸 What These Files Do Not Represent

None of the reports in this directory should be considered:

established physics

verified operator reconstructions

validated dark-matter modeling

accepted lensing solutions

cosmological predictions

formal derivations

finalized equations

evidence for or against GenFT

All documents may contain:

coding mistakes

incorrect assumptions

numerical artifacts

misinterpretations

oversimplified operators

AI-generated explanatory errors

These materials exist only for transparency and reproducibility, not to assert correctness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔸 Purpose of This Folder

This directory is provided so that others may:

review the methodology

identify mathematical or numerical errors

provide expert correction

critique the approach

attempt independent reproduction

evaluate whether the operator-based framework is mathematically viable

These files reflect the iterative research process behind exploring dark-matter mode structure within GenesisFT.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔸 Until Independent Experts Validate This Work

⚠️ None of the operator results, eigenmode decompositions, lensing analyses, or ΔK(r) calculations should be treated as confirmed scientific findings.

This is early-stage exploratory work, and all claims remain speculative until reproduced by qualified astrophysics or mathematical-physics researchers.

For questions, clarifications, or feedback, see the main project README.
