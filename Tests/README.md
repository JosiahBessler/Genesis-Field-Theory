⚠️ Disclaimer — Preliminary, Unverified Test Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The documents in this Tests directory contain summaries and explanations that were generated with the assistance of large-language-model AI tools.
These summaries describe the testing procedures, interpret numerical results, and explain the logic behind each evaluation.

However:

🔸 All tests themselves were performed by a single independent, non-expert researcher.

There has been no external review, no astrophysics validation, and no replication by the scientific community.

🔸 Nothing in this folder should be considered confirmed, factual, or scientifically reliable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The test results, comparisons, BIC/χ² rankings, and model performance analyses are experimental only and may contain:

coding errors

misinterpretations

mistakes in methodology

incorrect assumptions

numerical artifacts

AI-generated explanation errors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔸 These results must NOT be treated as evidence for or against any physical theory.

They are intended solely for transparency, so others can:

review the methodology

identify errors

correct mistakes

attempt independent reproduction

evaluate whether the approach is meaningful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔸 Until multiple independent experts reproduce and validate the tests, none of the findings should be cited as scientific fact.

If you use or review these files, please approach them as early-stage exploratory work, not as verified cosmological results.

For questions, clarifications, or feedback, see the main project README.
