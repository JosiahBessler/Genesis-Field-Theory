⚠️ Disclaimer — Preliminary, Unverified Test Results
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains test results, numerical experiments, and diagnostic analyses
applied to the fixed GenesisFT / UCP model.
All numerical tests themselves were executed directly by the author using the
published code and data products in this repository. The model was treated as fixed
during testing; no test results were used to modify, tune, or redefine the theory
or its numerical template.

Some summaries and explanatory text in this folder were generated with the assistance
of large-language-model AI tools to improve clarity and readability. AI assistance
was not used to generate numerical results or to alter raw outputs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

• All tests were conducted by a single independent researcher.

• There has been no external peer review or independent replication.

• No astrophysical validation beyond internal consistency checks has been performed.

As a result, the interpretations, comparisons, rankings (e.g. BIC/χ²), and qualitative
conclusions presented here should be regarded as preliminary and exploratory.

WHAT THESE FILES ARE — AND ARE NOT

✔ These files document:
  - the methodology used to test the fixed model
  - the numerical outputs of those tests
  - diagnostic and consistency analyses
  - exploratory interpretation of results

✖ These files do NOT:
  - establish empirical confirmation of GenesisFT
  - constitute validated evidence for or against dark matter
  - represent consensus scientific conclusions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE OF THIS FOLDER

The contents of this directory are provided for transparency, so that others may:

• review the testing methodology

• inspect the numerical outputs

• identify possible errors or limitations

• attempt independent reproduction

• evaluate whether the approach is meaningful

Until multiple independent experts reproduce and validate these tests, none of the
results here should be cited as established scientific fact.

For background, model definitions, and theoretical context, see the main project
README and the documents in the repository root.
